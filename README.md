# greenthumb


## Description

AS A USER I want to plan my garden and get ideas for recipes.

Our motivation for this project was to create an application that would help the user start a garden in an organized and efficient way. With Greenthumb, the user can create a garden with (up to) 8 plots and determine what would be best to plant based on harvest time, yield, sunlight and water requirements, uses and other factors.


## Installation

Type the following into your terminal or command line to copy this repository:

`git clone git@github.com:twohunters/greenthumb.git`

The deployed application can be foud [here](https://fierce-forest-99960.herokuapp.com/).
